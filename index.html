        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an international primary school teacher and budding web developer from London, UK. I live in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with my wife and three sons. I grew up in London then moved to Brighton for university before leaving the UK in 2011. In my early career, I worked in food services, taking various roles including waiter, bartender, and kitchen assistant. However, my favourite of these early jobs was working as a security guard at London's O2 Arena.</p>
        <p>After graduating from university, I spent two years backpacking and working around South-East Asia and Australia. During this time, I worked as grill chef in a gourmet burger restaurant in Brisbane, and as receptionist at backpacker hostels in Brisbane and Katoomba. I then spent three months backpacking in the United States before finally settling in Thailand in April 2013. I lived in a small market town in rural Chiang Rai for 3.5 years, which was possibly the most amazing place I have ever lived in my life. I was surrounded by beautiful rice fields and forest-covered mountains, and cycled every day. After the birth of my first son, I moved to the city of Chiang Rai and then to Chiang Mai in December 2018.</p>
        <p>I have been a teacher for 8.5 years, and during this time have studied a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (international), a Master of Arts in Education, and have completed several professional development courses. I have gained valuable experience teaching in face to face, online, and blended learning environments, and multiple educational settings. I have extensive experience in curriculum development, working with the Cambridge International Primary Curriculum and the National Curricula of the UK, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>
        <p>My current contract ends in June 2022 and I am exploring my options for the following academic year.</p>
